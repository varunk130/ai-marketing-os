# Security Policy

This repository is a Next.js demo site that runs entirely on synthetic data - no live customer records, no production credentials. If you find a security issue in the app code, the agent/skill definitions, or any guidance that could lead a user to leak credentials or PII, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use one of these private channels:

1. **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** - open a private advisory on this repository's Security tab. This is the preferred channel.
2. **Direct message** - reach the maintainer through the contact information on their GitHub profile.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal proof-of-concept if possible)
- The affected file, commit SHA, route, or agent name
- Any suggested remediation
- Whether you would like public credit when the fix is released

## What to expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 7 days
- A **triage decision** (accepted, needs more info, out of scope) within 14 days
- A **coordinated disclosure timeline** once the issue is confirmed
- **Public credit** in the release notes, with your consent

## Scope

In scope:

- The Next.js application code under `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/`
- Agent and skill definitions that could cause credential leakage, PII exposure, or unsafe automation if followed verbatim
- Sample configuration or fixtures in `data/` that use real (rather than placeholder) secrets
- Dependency vulnerabilities that are actually reachable from the shipped site

Out of scope:

- Findings that depend on the user supplying genuine production credentials or live customer data to this demo
- Issues in third-party services referenced in the agent examples - please report those to the relevant vendor
- Stylistic or wording concerns - open a regular issue or pull request for those

## Supported versions

Only the latest commit on `main` is actively supported. Older snapshots are not patched. If you are running an older fork, please pull the latest before reporting.
